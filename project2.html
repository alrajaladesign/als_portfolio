<h1>Open Books Content Restructure</h1></center>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This project was a semester-long project completed in a group of three for a Content Strategy and Information Architecture class during my master’s program. The aim of the project was to choose a website and restructure its navigation based on research conducted throughout the course of the class. The website that we restructured was <a href=”open-books.org"> Open Books </a>, a Chicago based nonprofit that works to promote literacy through their programs. We chose this website because the information architecture left something to be desired and we thought we could improve upon it. </p>
<br><br>
<h3> First Steps</h3>
<p>	Our first move was to complete a content inventory in order to get an idea of what the site’s content was. After completing the content inventory, we saw that content was split up in ways that made it more confusing to access and could gain from some areas being consolidated into one page. For example, they have different online shopping links in the main navigation area, although going to the main online shopping page allows you to choose which location to buy from. 
</p>
<p>	After the consolidation of repeat content, we came up with the categories that the pages could fit into and made a draft sitemap. With the different pages from that draft sitemap, we set up a card sort and ran a pilot study in class. During this pilot, we identified some cards that were confusing and changed their names and reorganized content as we found necessary, before launching the first official round of testing. 
</p>
<p>	Our first round had only five participants, allowing us to complete it quickly and efficiently. Looking at the data from this round, we found that the name “access to books” was confusing to people, as two out of five put it in the not sure category and the rest of the participants all chose different options. We took a closer look at the content on the page and decided to rename it “Grant Information”, as that was the majority of the content covered in that area of the site.
