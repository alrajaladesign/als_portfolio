<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This project was for an Introduction to User-Centered Design class in my master’s program and completed with a team of five people altogether. We chose the domain of food service and went through the entire design cycle in an attempt to design a system that would better serve food service employees than what they already have access to.</p>
<br>
<h3>Discover</h3>
<p>Our team conducted ten semi-structured interviews with people we knew who either currently or previously worked in the food service industry. We met and went over the data that we collected to identify personas that could be extracted from the overall picture that we created. We came up with four personas that we were designing for, including a line cook, a barista, a caterer, and a store manager. </p>

<h3>Define</h3>
<p>Later, after individually going over the interview data, we all created work activity notes and completed a group work activity affinity diagram for both the obstacles and goals of personas in the domain. </p>

<p>Using this activity, we narrowed our scope to something that could likely be solved by one system and would fit within the class’ timeline. We decided to focus on interruption and the memory issues that it creates, while also integrating the multiple necessary systems of food service into one, convenient-to-use system that would make things like inventory and scheduling easier for those in manager positions, while also assisting floor employees in their goals. In the figure below, the purple sticky notes represent goals that we thought could be helped by this system.

<h3> Ideate </h3>
<p>Once our scope was narrowed to this area, we split up to individually sketch out some initial ideas. After these were complete, we met again and went over everyone’s individual ideas, pointing out features that we liked, and things that could perhaps add more obstacles to the process rather than being helpful. At the end of this meeting, we had a list of features and requirements for our system, the most important being the following: 
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Role specific interfaces to avoid clutter and overcomplication</li>
    <li>Task recovery reminder system for waitstaff/floor staff</li>
    <li>Shorthand recipe displays for kitchen staff</li>
</ul>
<p>These last two features were added to our system based on interview data illustrating the constant interruptions present in food service. By having a reminder system that can be dismissed with one tap, waitstaff can be sure they didn’t forget something when they are multitasking. Similarly, shorthand recipes can support kitchen staff when they leave a task and return later, by looking at the steps and recognizing where they left off rather than trying to remember with no outside input.</p>
